				<h2>THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FADES, TAPERS, AND BLENDS</h2>
				<p>Thinking of trying out a brand-new look, but not exactly sure how to explain 
				it to your stylist? One way to help ensure you get a cut you 
				love is to bring in a pic or two to share with your POPULARITY SALON
				stylist. And another way to help the conversation along is
				to have these basic haircut terms down.</p>
				<img src="images/sampson_dinosaur3.jpg" alt="SS3" width="90%">
				<h3>Hi-Top Fade <br>
					Good For:
					Curly, Thick, Wavy, Texture</h3>
					<p>Long on top, tighter on the sides, the hi-top fade is a throwback to '80s and '90s 
						fashion that’s a hot trend for 2019. A free-handed clipper cut that can easily be 
						customized, there are endless variations possible.</p>
					<h3>Longer Comb Over <br>
					Good For:
					Curly, Thin, Wavy, Straight</h3>
					<p>Show off healthy, shiny hair with a side part and long layers. By creating a firm part 
						and combing the layers to the side, the face is framed and natural highlights come to life.
						 A classic old Hollywood style, give the cut new life by giving it a messy, piece-y look or 
						 sweeping it back into a pompadour.</p>
					<h3>Longer Layers <br>
					Good For
					Curly, Thin, Wavy, Straight</h3>
					<p>Want to keep your thick hair in check, while keeping some length? One way is with the classic 
						longer layers cut. First, the sides and back are trimmed. Then the top is cut with a scissors-and-comb 
						cutting technique. It’s then joined with the sides and back. Finally, this sharp style is finished with a 
						cleaned-up, square neckline that brings together the overall look. Clean and trim without being boring, 
						long layers offer a number of styling options so you can change up the look with the help of a product or two.</p>
					<h3>Taper Fade <br>
						Good For
						Curly, Thick, Wavy, Texture</h3>
						<p>It’s all about the transitions with the timeless taper fade. 
							The hair is clipper cut, and made gradually shorter, until 
							it reaches the ears and neckline. The front hairline can be 
							lined up to give it a very finished look. The taper fade is 
							a fresh, detailed cut that’s great for naturally textured 
							hair. A no-fuss option for the guy who likes to wash and go, 
							this cut will look fresh and sharp every day.</p>
							<h3>Textured Comb Over <br>
								Good For:
								Curly, Thin-to-Thick, Wavy, Texture</h3>
								<p>Want a men’s haircut with a little length that still 
									looks neat and cleaned up? A long clipper haircut like 
									this may be just the thing. First, a clipper is used to cut 
									the sides and back to around 3/4 of an inch. Then the top is 
									scissor trimmed with the short sides and back to bring the 
									ook together for a smooth transition. The style’s completed 
									with a sharp neckline that’s kept tight over the ears and 
									blends into the sideburns. It’s a solid choice for the guy 
									who doesn’t want to go super short, and wants flexibility to 
									change up the look for different occasions.</p>
									<h3>Textured Pompadour <br>
									Good For
				Curly, Thick, Wavy, Straight</h3>
				<p>Classic, iconic and never boring, today’s casual pompadour holds strong as one of 
					the most stylish of men’s cuts. By pairing tight sides with long layers, the cut 
					can be tailored to best suit your face shape and styling preferences. Longer layers 
					make for a smooth lift, while a shorter version can be spiked and sporty. A complementary 
					cut for all face shapes, it can be quickly styled for daily wear or made into more statement-worthy 
					looks with the right products.</p>
					<h3>Traditional Brush Up <br>
						Good For
						Curly, Thick, Wavy, Texture</h3>
						<p>Low on maintenance, high on style, the brush up is a fool-proof style for a guy on the go. With its 
							clean lines and sharp neckline, it looks fresh and professional, but with a little product it can 
							be made more messy and spiky. All face shapes are complemented by this cut, and it works well for 
							all hair types and textures too.</p>
					<p>From easy-to-understand styling tips to the latest in hair care products, 
					POPULARITY SALON is here to help you get a look you'll love.</p>
