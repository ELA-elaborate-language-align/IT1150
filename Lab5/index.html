				<h2>THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FADES, TAPERS, AND BLENDS</h2>
				<p>Thinking of trying out a brand-new look, but not exactly sure how to explain 
				it to your stylist? One way to help ensure you get a cut you 
				love is to bring in a pic or two to share with your POPULARITY SALON
				stylist. And another way to help the conversation along is
				to have these basic haircut terms down.</p>

				<h3>Classic Fade <br>
					Good For: Curly, Thick, Wavy, Texture</h3>
					<p>A modern take on the age-old crew cut, the fade is a 
						timeless style that keeps you looking fresh and sharp.
						Kept short and tight at the bottom, the length gradually 
						gets longer at the top of the head. The fade is a fresh, 
						detailed look that’s perfect for naturally textured hair 
						but looks sharp on all hair types. You’ll always look 
						polished with this cut.</p>
						<h3>Clipper cut with brush back <br>
							Good For:
							Curly, Thick, Wavy, Texture</h3>
							<p>A go-to haircut that never goes out of style, the crew 
								cut is a classic. An easy-to-manage cut for the modern, 
								busy guy, it requires very little styling to keep it 
								looking sharp. Detailed clipper work in the back and 
								sides gives it a clean and sharp look. Then short layers 
								on top are created with a clipper-over-comb technique, 
								and expertly blended in for a smooth transition. 
								A strong neckline is carved with the neck trimmer to 
								finish the look. To make your neck look strong and thick, 
								ask for a square neckline to create a strong. Or for a more 
								slender-looking neck, opt for a round neckline.</p>
