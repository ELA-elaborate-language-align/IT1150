			<h2>Making the Transition Between Hair Colors</h2>
			<p>No matter if you’re going for something extreme 
				or subtle, changing your hair color can be a 
				confusing process. Here are some things to consider 
				when you’re thinking about switching it up.</p>
				<p>And don’t forget, you can always head to your 
					local Supercuts for a complimentary hair color 
					consultation with one of our experts. Let’s get 
					into it:</p>
			
			<h1>Growing out highlights</h1>
			<p>If you want to grow out your highlights, our experts 
				recommend having them glazed. This Supercuts service 
				will reduce the contrast between your highlights and 
				natural color, eliminating any tell-tale lines. Your 
				tylist will re-energize your highlights with a new tone 
				so they continue to grow out beautifully. </p>
			</br>
			<h1>Blending gray</h1>
			<p>Starting to notice some grays? It’s tempting to break out 
				the tweezers and start plucking but resist the urge. 
				When the new hairs grow in, they’ll be short and stick out. 
				Plucking also can damage the follicle and cause hair to
				 become thin down the road.</p>
				 <p>The best course of action to get some natural looking 
					 coverage is to try a gray blending. This color service 
					 camouflages the white hair with a washable dye, 
					 and leaves just a minimal appearance of gray. 
					 It’s great for men who are after a “salt-and-pepper” look, 
					 but want to exude a more youthful energy. Plus, it washes 
					 out uniformly, so you won’t have to worry about roots or lines.</p>

				<h2>Work-Appropriate Hairstyles for Guys</h2>
				<p>Your hairstyle says a lot about you. 
					And like it or not, your profession often 
					influences how you wear your hair. 
					It’s time to see if your ‘do and styling 
					products deserve a promotion — or a pink slip.</p>

				<p>As the seasons change and summer comes to an end, we make changes 
					like swapping out flip flops in exchange for boots and trading in 
					tanks for sweaters. But our wardrobe isn’t all that needs to be 
					updated for cooler weather.</p>
					<p>Our haircare habits need to change, too. As temps and humidity decrease, 
						the moisture in hair slowly dries out, leaving it brittle and prone to 
						breakage.</p>
						<p>Welcome the arrival of autumn with a hair trim to remove any damaged ends, 
							then keep your hair healthy with these three changes to your daily routine.</p>
							<h3>Infuse with moisture</h3>
							<p>Keep your hair from drying out, or repair already dry hair, by boosting its 
								moisture level. Start with moisture-rich products, like Biolage Hydrasource 
								Shampoo and Conditioner. They'll gently cleanse and moisturize, while sealing 
								the cuticle to lock in moisture. Then once a week use a moisturizing hair mask 
								for extra conditioning. Paul Mitchell Awapuhi Wild Ginger Keratin Intensive 
								Treatment is an effective option and gives hair a remarkable shine. And with 
								each wash, keep the water temp low because hot water can zap the moisture out 
								of hair.</p>
