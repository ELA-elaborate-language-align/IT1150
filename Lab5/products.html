			<h2>Our Hair Products</h2>
			<p>Hair Care products are those that help to control 
				the properties and behavior of the hair so that it 
				can be maintained in a controlled and desirable manner. 
				This can include hair conditioners, hair sprays, hair 
				straighteners and relaxers, permanent waves, shampoos, 
				rinses, tonics and dressings.</p>
				<h2>Tonics and Dressings</h2>
				<p>Tonics and Dressings are products that are intended 
					facilitate combing and styling of the hair. 
					They can be applied directly to the hair or by application 
					to the brush or comb. The safety of these products is ensured 
					through the careful selection of ingredients that are safe 
					for these products. Manufacturers conduct extensive safety 
					tests to ensure that these products are safe. Among the tests 
					conducted, are those to ensure that the products are not 
					irritating or that they do not cause allergic reactions.</p>
					<h2>Shampoos and Rinses</h2>
					<p>Shampoos and Rinses are products that are intended to cleanse the hair. 
						Rinses are intended to help condition the hair after shampooing. 
						Some formulations are Shampoos and Rinses in the same product. 
						The safety of these products is ensured through the careful selection 
						of ingredients that are safe for these products. Manufacturers 
						conduct extensive safety tests to ensure that these products 
						are safe. Among the tests conducted are those to ensure that 
						the products are not irritating or that they cause allergic 
						reactions.</p>
						<h2>Permanent Waves</h2>
						<p>Permanent Waves are treatment of the hair intended to produce 
							curls or to alter existing curls. In cosmetology, it is 
							termed a type of curl reformation. Humans have been attempting 
							to add curl to straight hair for thousands of years. The ancient 
							Egyptians did this by wrapping their hair around wooden sticks; 
							slathering it with mud from hot springs; letting it bake dry in 
							the sun and then removing the mud. Presumably the mud had an alkaline 
							chemical makeup that helped to set the curls.</p>

				<h2>THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FADES, TAPERS, AND BLENDS</h2>

				love is to bring in a pic or two to share with your POPULARITY SALON
				stylist. And another way to help the conversation along is
