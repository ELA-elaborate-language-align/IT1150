Part 2 Hands-On:
Start with your lab 1 html and css files or, if you had difficulty, use the lab 2 files in this repo. Read all of the requirements and draw your web page as you expect it to look. Scan and include this file in your submission.

If your file does not already have semantic tags add: nav, section, article and footer tags (see sample file)

Add two more pages to your web site: about and contact and rename your "home" page to index.html

In the "section" tag add a paragraph and ordered list

Both the paragraph and ordered list elements are both "boxes." Add a border, padding and a margin to either of these elements and format them with css

Edit your css file to include styles for the border, margin and padding areas of your boxes. Be sure to also have paragraph tags in your other two pages so that you can see the impact

Edit your css file to include (and implement) classes and ids (in all three pages.)

Be sure to include links to both stylesheets (normalize.css and your stylesheet) in all three pages.

Take a screen shot of your web page in the browser and name the file "Lab2WebPage1, Lab2WebPage2, Lab2Webpage3" Upload your images to the Lab1 directory

Conclusion:
"Type your lab conclusion here... be sure to include a discussion describing your box model and implementation of css."
