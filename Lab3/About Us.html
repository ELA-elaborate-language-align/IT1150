                            everyday. Growing up in the historical city of 
                            Sibiu (Hermannstadt) located in the 
                            Carpathian Mountains, ANA loved to work beside
                            her mother learning all the SECRET RECIPES. 
                            When she moved in US, she continued to 
                            nutrition-ate her passion by getting enrolled in
                            different classes to acquire the proper education.

    <h2>PROCESS</h2>
        <p>We are often asked what sets our pierogies apart. 
            We believe our secret ingredient is the process;
            all of our pierogies are hand-crafted using only 
            the finest ingredients.</p>
        </br>
        <p> The dough is rolled thin in our large rolling
             machine. This ensures a consistently delicate 
             thickness and texture. Once the dough is ready, 
             it is carefully rolled out and cut into perfect 
             circles. Any excess dough is pulled away to be 
             pressed again and used for additional pierogies.</p>
        </br>
        <p> We then portion the filling into the dough and
            skillfully fold and pinch each pierogi by hand.</p>
        </br>
        <p>The last step involves boiling the pierogies until
         they are fully cooked. Once they are ready, 
         they are lightly oiled and trayed for cooling.
         Each pierogi is then hand-packed for delivery.</p>
